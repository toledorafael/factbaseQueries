# Applying Program-Comprehension Questions to Graphical Software Models - Literature Review
 
This repository includes the files accompanying the section 3.1 *Program-Comprehension Questions* of the thesis chapter *Applying Program-Comprehension Questions to Graphical Software Models*. The presented information describes the results of the literature review performed to identify program comprehension questions that can be supported by fact-based models.

## File description

The sections below explain the spreadsheet files included in this repository.

### literatureQuestions
This file shows the results of listing all questions found in software engineering literature. Questions are listed with their local id and source reference in parentheses.

### questionCategorization
This file shows the results of categorizing all questions found in software engineering literature in order to identify the code-related and program-comprehension questions. 

### coderClassification
This file shows the results of classifying the model-supported questions according to the mid- and low-level information visualization task and their data requirements (input and output). The file include two separate tabs for each coder.

### executedQueries
This file shows the results of the exercise of writing queries to the factbase-supported questions by listing the question and its query translation.
